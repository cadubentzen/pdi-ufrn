## Digital Image Processing

This website is a showcase of small projects developed during the course of Digital Image Processing offered by Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Norte, Department of Computer Engineering.

These exercises are based on the OpenCV tutorial provided by professor Agostinho Brito Jr (http://agostinhobritojr.github.io/tutoriais/pdi/). 

OpenCV 2.4 has been used in this material.
