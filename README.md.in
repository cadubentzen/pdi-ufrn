## Digital Image Processing

**PAGE IN PROGRESS - DESCRIPTIONS AND IMAGES NEED TO BE ADDED YET**

This website is a showcase of small projects developed during the course of Digital Image Processing offered by Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Norte, Department of Computer Engineering.

These exercises are based on the OpenCV tutorial provided by professor Agostinho Brito Jr (http://agostinhobritojr.github.io/tutoriais/pdi/). 

OpenCV 2.4 has been used in this material.

### Negative of a region

![Negative Region](results/result_regions.png "Negative region")

This is a typical "getting started" example to OpenCV, because it uses simple pixel manipulation in order to make a negative effect in a region of the given image.

To invert the color of a pixel, the formula used is `color = 255 - color` in each channel. To run this example: `./regions <img_path> <x1> <y1> <x2> <y2>` where x1, y1, x2 and y2 the rectangular area to be turned into negative.
